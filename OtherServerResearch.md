### Mineplex Draw My Thing

On this game, the player to guess the word first receives `+3` points and each subsequent player gets `+1` point. The artist, after just one correct guess, receives `+2` points. Unknown whether or not the artist gets points if each player guesses it.

As for the timing, it appears a little unclear. When there were 15 seconds left, it went to 5 seconds after someone guessed correctly. Then it went 37 seconds to 26 seconds. The pattern would show that 10 seconds are subtracted each time someone guesses correctly, unless it's below 10 seconds I'd assume, or perhaps 5 seconds after the first person gets it right then 10 seconds after each person. Something like that!

### HiveMC DrawIt

It appears each round starts with 70 seconds. Upon successful guess, the first guesser gets 10 points. Second gets 8, third gets 6, fourth gets 4, fifth and everyone after that gets 2. The artist gets 2 points for each person to successfully guess it. The time maybe drops once but couldn't quite tell. 

### Hypixel Guess the Build

Hint revealed after 30 seconds. First person to guess gets 3 points, artist gets 2. Each guess after gets 1 point. The time starts at 120 seconds, and goes down to 90 seconds after first guess. Then it goes down more- I think to 60-, and after I think 4 or 5 guesses goes straight to 5 seconds left. **Don't spam filter the chat in this game!** God it's so annoying.
